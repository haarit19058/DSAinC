/*
A segment tree is used to store information about array intervals in its ndoe
it allows efficient range queries over array intervals
along with queries it allows efficient update of arrya times
We can perform a range summation of an array between the range L to R in O(log n) while also modifyigany array elemtne in Ologn time

The following are few example queries over a range in an array.

Addition/Subtraction
Maximum/Minimum
